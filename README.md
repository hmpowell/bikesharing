## Overview of the Analysis

The purpose of this analysis was to look at bikeshare data from NYC Citibike to determine if the program would be profitable if it were duplicated in Des Moines, Iowa. We utilized heat maps, line graphs, and bar graphs within Tableau to showcase the data for investors.

## Results

### User Trips by Gender by Weekday

![This is a heat map showing user trips by gender by weekday](https://github.com/hmpowell/bikesharing/blob/main/Gender_Weekday.png)

This is a heat map showing user trips by gender by weekday. This graphic shows that male subscribers are more likely to use Citibikes, especially on Thursdays and Fridays.

### Stoptime Per Hour Per Day

This is a heat map showing stoptime per hour per day. Commuting hours and afternoons on Saturdays and Sundays have the highest usage time.

### Stoptime Per Hour Per Day Per Gender

This is a heat map showing stop time per hour per day per gender. This graphic confirms that men utilize the service more, and that commuting times and weekends have the highest usage.

### Trip Duration

This is a line graph showing how long users spend on the bikes per trip. For each minute demarcation from 1-26, there are over 30,000 users, with a peak number of users with a trip duration of 5 minutes. This tells us that the majority of users utilize the bikes for a period of less than 26 minutes, with very few people using the bikes for an hour.

### Trip Duration Per Gender

![This is a line graph with 3 lines showing how long users spend on bikes per trip per gender](https://github.com/hmpowell/bikesharing/blob/main/Trip_Duration_Per_Gender.png)

This is a line graph with 3 lines showing how long users spend on bikes per trip per gender. This confirms what we saw in the last several graphics - men are more likely to use the service, and all users spend less than 26 minutes on the bikes.

### Starttime

![This is a horizontal bar graph showing what time users begin their trips on the bikes](https://github.com/hmpowell/bikesharing/blob/main/Start_Times.png)

This is a bar graph showing what time users begin their trips on the bikes. There are minimal users from 1-5am and the majority of users are on the bikes from 8-9am and 4-7pm. This confirms that the bikes are being used during rush hour commutes. The midday bike rides may be from the increased weekend usage. We should consider doing any bike repairs or changes to the system during the lowest ridership period (1-5am).

### Starting Locations

![This is a map showing where the starting locations are with larger and darker dots to represent the more popular starting locations](https://github.com/hmpowell/bikesharing/blob/main/Start_Location_Map.png)

This is a map showing where the starting locations are with larger and darker dots to represent the more popular starting locations. It is important to have more bikes available in the more popular starting locations, so as to drive usership.

## Summary

To summarize the graphs above, men are more likely to use Citibikes than women. Also, the highest usage is during rush hour times, more in the evening than the morning. There is also some ridership on weekends; however, this is less than the weekday commutes. The majority of users are not utilizing the bikes for hours, but are using them for under half an hour, which makes sense if they are commuting to work. From the map, we can see that there are clusters of higher usage in similar areas with less usage in the outskirts of the city. We would need to do more analysis on the types of businesses that are within this area to determine the best places to put new bikes in Des Moines. We would need to target working men in order to begin the bikeshare business and then spread out to engaging women and those who do not work normal business hours.

For further analysis:
1. We may want to consider analyzing usage based on birth year to determine the specific age range we would want to target in the new city.
2. We may also want to analyze other months. It snows in Iowa in winter, so the bikes may not be usable then. We could see what January ridership is like in NYC for reference. Planning for your worst month is just as important as planning for your best month.
